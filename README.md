Student Management System - Part 1

Title: Student Management System

Project Overview:

The Student Management System is a console-based application designed to manage student information for a school or educational institution. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records, as well as perform various operations related to their academic details.

Key Features:

Student Information Management:

Add new student records with details such as name, roll number, age, address, and contact information.
View and update existing student information.
Course and Grade Management:

Assign courses to students and manage their grades for each course.
Calculate GPA and generate transcripts based on the grades obtained.
Search and Sorting:

Implement search functionalities to find students by name, roll number, or any other criteria.
Incorporate sorting algorithms to sort student records based on different attributes.

Technical Components:

Use object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to create classes for students and courses, with functions for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting records.
Implement file handling to store student data persistently in files (e.g., text files).
Utilize data structures such as arrays or vectors to manage student records efficiently.
Include input validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and program robustness.

Additional Challenges:

Implement a simple login system to provide different access levels (admin, teacher, student) with varying permissions.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like SFML or Qt for improved user interaction.
Extend functionality to calculate various statistics, such as class averages, top-performing students, etc.
